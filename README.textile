This is a minimal example of using the "sbt-cxf plugin":https://github.com/arktekk/sbt-cxf. In order to run this you
should install "sbt":https://github.com/harrah/xsbt version 0.11 or higher.

h2. Service Used

The test service used is an extremely simple "ping-pong service":http://www.service-repository.com/service/overview/-1878848421.
Source of "wsdl-file":http://www-inf.int-evry.fr/cours/WebServices/TP_BPEL/files/PingPong.wsdl.
It will simply consume server time by repeating the messages you send it.

h2. How To Run

The test example generates source from the downloaded wsdl-file and tests it from the Main.scala application.
